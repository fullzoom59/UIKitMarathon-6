# Inertia Square

There is a blue quadart on the screen. On pressing the screen, the center of the square moves animatedly to the point of pressing.

* The square should move like a physical object - if it travels a long distance, there is a bounce with inertia.
* There is a slight rotation of the square when moving to a new point.
